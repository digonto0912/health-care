                                The SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic is a global epidemic. On a global scale, the state of the pandemic in March 2020 was announced by the World Health Organization. Therefore, this organization could declare the end of the pandemic. On the other hand, the end of the epidemic on a regional, national or local scale can be announced by national central institutions of the health care system, including the ministries of health, in agreement with the government. In order to be able to declare the end of the epidemic on a national, regional or local scale, it is necessary to have a relatively large decrease in the number of new coronavirus infections, a decrease in the number of people seriously ill with Covid-19 disease and deaths caused by this disease. The decrease in Coronavirus infections and in sick people should be sustained in a longer period, i.e. min. several months, taking into account the periods of possible occurrence of subsequent epidemic waves caused by new variants of the Coronavirus and occurring in other regions of the world. In addition, an important factor that may be taken into account in the event of declaring the end of a pandemic on a global scale or an epidemic on a regional scale will be the level of vaccination of citizens with highly effective vaccines against Coronavirus and the level of social, collective immunity of the society achieved thanks to these vaccines.
